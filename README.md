## Story

### Prehistory
Humans have tried to create an AI named HOPE. This AI was designed to save the World from climate change but HOPE didnâ€™t see the point in nature and started to destroy it. Dr. John McCarthy, one of the main creators of HOPE, developed a second but not yet finished AI called {FRIENDLY_AI_NAME}. {FRIENDLY_AI_NAME} was created as a countermeasure to HOPE. Before Dr. McCarthy died, he hid {FRIENDLY_AI_NAME} at a secret place. For decades humans were searching for {FRIENDLY_AI_NAME}, with no luck. The faith to save the world as we know it is almost lost, just as human kind is.
