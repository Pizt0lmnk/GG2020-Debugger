## Story

### Prehistory
Humans have tried to create an AI named HOPE. This AI was designed to save the World from climate change but HOPE turned and started to destroy nature. Dr. John McCarthy, one of the main creators of HOPE, developed a second but not yet finished AI called J1mb0x. J1mb0x was created as a countermeasure to HOPE. Before Dr. McCarthy died, he hid J1mb0x at a secret place. For decades humans were searching for J1mb0x, with no luck. The faith to save the world as we know it is almost lost, just as human kind is.

### Main Storyline
Its the year 2500 human kind is almost extinct. HOPE, an almost omnipotent AI, destroys nature and life to gather more and more ressources to expand its technical empire. Meanwhile HOPEs highly intelligent androids are hunting down the remaining organical creatures.

A small enclave of human also known as the rebels are trying to survive in this cruel highly futuristic world. Lead by General Tulkin they are on a hunt for a last hope: J1mb0x an AI hidden by its creator, built to bring back balance between technical progress and Earth. But as the decades go by people are starting to loose their faith that J1mb0x exists.  

Alexei a Survivor with a dark past receives an unknown message. It contains a sentence that says "Itâ€™s worth fighting for." and some coordinates "51.1739726374 -1.82237671048". Against the will of those that love him, he packs his stuff and leaves. A last glance of this last hope everyone had. Knowing the great danger that lies upon him and his small chance of success, he is still willing to take the risk. All just to save human kind and his unborn child.
